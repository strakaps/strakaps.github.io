      <description>The new R package CTRE is now available on CRAN. “CTRE” stands for “Continuous Time Random Exceedances”, which is a model for extreme values of bursty time series. The theory is desribed in another paper (html|pdf).
library(CTRE) flares_ctre &amp;lt;- ctre(flares) plot(flares_ctre, log = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, main = &amp;quot;Solar Flares&amp;quot;) The above time series are measurements of solar flare magnitudes by NASA1. Which observations are considered extreme is defined by a variable threshold \(u\) (dashed line, \(&amp;lt; 5\%\) of observations).</description>
