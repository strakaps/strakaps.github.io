      <description>In the internship, you&amp;rsquo;ll explore the latest machine learning methods such as tree ensemble methods, graphical models and neural networks and compare their performance to what is the current industry standard. A great opportunity to improve your machine learning skills and create valuable insights for the credit risk industry.
Applications close 20 June, 2018.
