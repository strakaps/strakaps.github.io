      <description>See also the MJA podcast episode accompanying this article.
Our joint work (UNSW CBDRH and Statistics) which analyses Australian patient claim data using big network algorithms is now available on the MJA website. We have processed MBS claims data of 10% of Australians over the years 1994-2014, trying to shed light on the following research questions:
 What is the patient sharing behaviour of general practitioners (GPs): are there any meaningful clusters (called &amp;ldquo;Provider Practice Communities, PPC&amp;rdquo;) of GPs which collaborate and share patients?</description>

      <description>Last week I had the privilege to participate in the NUS-NUH-MIT DATATHON and Workshop on applications of AI in healthcare with the UNSW Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) team (Tim Churches, Mark Hanly, Oisin Fitzgerald and Oluwadamisola Sotade).
Thu &amp;amp; Fri: Workshop &amp;amp; Talks In the workshop &amp;ldquo;Deploying AI Solutions in Real Clinical Practices&amp;rdquo; by Dr Ngiam Kee Yuan (CTO, NUHS) we discussed

      <description>What is the network structure of healthcare providers and their practices/clinics? What is their patient sharing pattern? Does sharing of patient information between providers lead to better health outcomes? Do practice size and patient sharing behaviour influence the quality of healthcare?  Australian Medicare claims data contains data1 on tens of thousands of healthcare providers and millions of patients, such as patient characteristics (age, sex, &amp;hellip;) and provider characteristics (specialty, type and frequency of services delivered, bulk-billing behaviour,</description>

Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) data contain the dispensings of antidepressants and other pharmaceuticals, and data from the 45 and Up Study provide a gold standard response variable (a yes/no answer to &amp;ldquo;Have you been treated for depression?</description>
