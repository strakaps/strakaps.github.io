      <title>R package CTRE: thresholding bursty time series</title>

      <description>The new R package CTRE is now available on CRAN. “CTRE” means “Continuous Time Random Exceedances”, which is a model for extreme values of bursty time series.
library(CTRE) flares_ctre &amp;lt;- ctre(flares) plot(flares_ctre, log = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, main = &amp;quot;Solar Flares&amp;quot;) The above time series are measurements of solar flare magnitudes by NASA1. Which observations are considered extreme is defined by a variable threshold \(u\) (dashed line, \(&amp;lt; 5\%\) of observations). The exceedances of this threshold (red) follow (asymptotically for high \(u\)) a Generalized Pareto distribution Generalized Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>MittagLeffleR: Using the Mittag-Leffler distributions in R</title>

      <description>My PhD student Ricky Gill and I have created the R package MittagLeffleR, documented at strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/. It is available on CRAN (and the latest development version on GitHub). MittagLeffleR calculates both Mittag-Leffler distributions; i.e. probability density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and fast random variate generation. It was made possible by the Laplace inversion algorithm for the Mittag-Leffler function by Roberto Garrappa. Install it via
install.packages(&amp;quot;MittagLeffleR&amp;quot;) The Two Mittag-Leffler distributions Various journal articles (including my own) write about “the” Mittag-Leffler distribution, but actually there are two such families of distributions.</description>

      <title>Extremes of Bursty Time Series</title>

      <description>Extreme value theory is concerned with the modelling and prediction of extremes in a series of observations. Accurate estimates of probabilities for the exceedence of extreme levels of temperature, financial loss, the number of defective nodes in a network etc. are crucial for the control of risk in a great number of societal systems. &amp;ldquo;Mainstream&amp;rdquo; extreme value theory assumes that events happen uniformly, e.g. yearly, daily, or every second, or that events occur at a certain rate (Poisson process).</description>

      <title>Identifying antidepressant users with depression</title>

      <description>Records of antidepressant dispensings are often used in public health research as a surrogate measure of depression. In 1&amp;frasl;3 to 1&amp;frasl;2 of cases however, antidepressants are prescribed for indications other than depression, which results in misclassification.
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) data contain the dispensings of antidepressants and other pharmaceuticals, and data from the 45 and Up Study provide a gold standard response variable (a yes/no answer to &amp;ldquo;Have you been treated for depression?</description>
