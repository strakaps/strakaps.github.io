      <description>The new R package CTRE is now available on CRAN. “CTRE” stands for “Continuous Time Random Exceedances”, which is a model for extreme values of bursty time series. The theory is desribed in another paper (html|pdf).
library(CTRE) flares_ctre &amp;lt;- ctre(flares) plot(flares_ctre, log = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, main = &amp;quot;Solar Flares&amp;quot;) The above time series are measurements of solar flare magnitudes by NASA1. Which observations are considered extreme is defined by a variable threshold \(u\) (dashed line, \(&amp;lt; 5\%\) of observations).</description>

      <title>R package MittagLeffleR: Using the Mittag-Leffler distributions in R</title>

      <description>Ricky Gill and I have created the R package MittagLeffleR, documented at strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/. It is available on CRAN (and the latest development version on GitHub). MittagLeffleR calculates both Mittag-Leffler distributions; i.e. probability density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and fast random variate generation. It was made possible by the Laplace inversion algorithm for the Mittag-Leffler function by Roberto Garrappa. Install it via
install.packages(&amp;quot;MittagLeffleR&amp;quot;) The Two Mittag-Leffler distributions Various journal articles (including my own) write about “the” Mittag-Leffler distribution, but actually there are two such families of distributions.</description>
