      <description>Ricky Gill and I have created the R package MittagLeffleR, documented at strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/. It is available on CRAN (and the latest development version on GitHub). MittagLeffleR calculates both Mittag-Leffler distributions; i.e. probability density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and fast random variate generation. It was made possible by the Laplace inversion algorithm for the Mittag-Leffler function by Roberto Garrappa. Install it via
install.packages(&amp;quot;MittagLeffleR&amp;quot;) The Two Mittag-Leffler distributions Various journal articles (including my own) write about “the” Mittag-Leffler distribution, but actually there are two such families of distributions.</description>

      <description>Extreme value theory is concerned with the modelling and prediction of extremes in a series of observations. Accurate estimates of probabilities for the exceedence of extreme levels of temperature, financial loss, the number of defective nodes in a network etc. are crucial for the control of risk in a great number of societal systems. &amp;ldquo;Mainstream&amp;rdquo; extreme value theory assumes that events happen uniformly, e.g. yearly, daily, or every second, or that events occur at a certain rate (Poisson process).</description>
