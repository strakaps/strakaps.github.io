      <description>What is the network structure of healthcare providers and their practices/clinics? What is their patient sharing pattern? Does sharing of patient information between providers lead to better health outcomes? Do practice size and patient sharing behaviour influence the quality of healthcare?  Australian Medicare claims data contains data1 on tens of thousands of healthcare providers and millions of patients, such as patient characteristics (age, sex, &amp;hellip;) and provider characteristics (specialty, type and frequency of services delivered, bulk-billing behaviour,</description>

      <description>Diffusion is the net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration as a result of random motion of the molecules or atoms (Wikipedia).
Due to a discovery by Einstein (1905), a universal model for the random motion of microscopic particles is Brownian motion, whose mean-squared displacement increases linearly with time.
In many system with particles more complex than tiny molecules which interact with their environment (e.</description>

      <description>Extreme value theory is concerned with the modelling and prediction of extremes in a series of observations. Accurate estimates of probabilities for the exceedence of extreme levels of temperature, financial loss, the number of defective nodes in a network etc. are crucial for the control of risk in a great number of societal systems. &amp;ldquo;Mainstream&amp;rdquo; extreme value theory assumes that events happen uniformly, e.g. yearly, daily, or every second, or that events occur at a certain rate (Poisson process).</description>

      <title>Identifying antidepressant users with depression</title>

      <description>Records of antidepressant dispensings are often used in public health research as a surrogate measure of depression. In 1&amp;frasl;3 to 1&amp;frasl;2 of cases however, antidepressants are prescribed for indications other than depression, which results in misclassification.
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) data contain the dispensings of antidepressants and other pharmaceuticals, and data from the 45 and Up Study provide a gold standard response variable (a yes/no answer to &amp;ldquo;Have you been treated for depression?</description>
