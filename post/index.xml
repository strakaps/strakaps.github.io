      <description>Last week I had the privilege to participate in the NUS-NUH-MIT DATATHON and Workshop on applications of AI in healthcare with the UNSW Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) team (Tim Churches, Mark Hanly, Oisin Fitzgerald and Oluwadamisola Sotade).
Thu &amp;amp; Fri: Workshop &amp;amp; Talks In the workshop &amp;ldquo;Deploying AI Solutions in Real Clinical Practices&amp;rdquo; by Dr Ngiam Kee Yuan (CTO, NUHS) we discussed
 The large NUHS (National University Health System) databases and their storage structure Data security and ownership Applications for access to data The always changing standards of diagnosis codes (ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED, &amp;hellip;) and the problem of matching doctors diagnoses to these codes.</description>

      <description>In the internship, you&amp;rsquo;ll explore the latest machine learning methods such as tree ensemble methods, graphical models and neural networks and compare their performance to what is the current industry standard. A great opportunity to improve your machine learning skills and create valuable insights for the credit risk industry.
Applications close 20 June, 2018.

      <title>Fractional Diffusion where &#34;fractional&#34; varies in space</title>
      <link>https://strakaps.github.io/post/voffpe/</link>

      <description>The new paper (arxiv.org/abs/1712.06767)
 Variable Order Fractional Fokker-Planck Equations derived from Continuous Time Random Walks
 is currently under review.
The variable order fractional Fokker-Planck equation (VOFFPE), in simple form1, is \[\frac{\partial}{\partial t} p(x,t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \underbrace{D_t^{1-\beta(x)}}_{\text{fractional derivative}} p(x,t).\]
 If you take out the fractional derivative operator, you get the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). It describes the spreading of probability via a random walk:   Adding in the fractional derivative \[D_t^{1-\beta} p(x,t) = \int_0^t p(x,t-s) \frac{s^{-\beta}}{\Gamma(1-\beta)}\,ds\] results in the “fractional FPE”.</description>

      <title>R package MittagLeffleR: Using the Mittag-Leffler distributions in R</title>
      <link>https://strakaps.github.io/post/mittag-leffler/</link>

      <description>Ricky Gill and I have created the R package MittagLeffleR, documented at strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/. It is available on CRAN (and the latest development version on GitHub). MittagLeffleR calculates both Mittag-Leffler distributions; i.e. probability density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and fast random variate generation. It was made possible by the Laplace inversion algorithm for the Mittag-Leffler function by Roberto Garrappa. Install it via
install.packages(&amp;quot;MittagLeffleR&amp;quot;) The Two Mittag-Leffler distributions Various journal articles (including my own) write about “the” Mittag-Leffler distribution, but actually there are two such families of distributions.</description>
