      <description>Suppose you want to model time series data with irregularly spaced events, and suppose your main focus is the timing and the size of the extreme events. The max-renewal process is a conceptually easy model that does this… and now there’s an app that can fit it to data:
 Irregular spacing The renewal process does simple i.i.d. draws \(W_i\) from a distribution, and uses these as waiting times between events.</description>

      <title>MittagLeffleR: Using the Mittag-Leffler distributions in R</title>

      <description>My PhD student Ricky Gill and I have created the R package MittagLeffleR, documented at strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/. It is available on CRAN (and the latest development version on GitHub). MittagLeffleR calculates both Mittag-Leffler distributions; i.e. probability density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and fast random variate generation. It was made possible by the Laplace inversion algorithm for the Mittag-Leffler function by Roberto Garrappa. Install it via
install.packages(&amp;quot;MittagLeffleR&amp;quot;) The Two Mittag-Leffler distributions Various journal articles (including my own) write about “the” Mittag-Leffler distribution, but actually there are two such families of distributions.</description>
